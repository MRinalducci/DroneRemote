## Getting Started

The following frame (11 bytes) is sent via Bluetooth :
Start = 240 
Throttle = 0-100%
Yaw = 0-100%
Pitch = 0-100% 
Roll = 0-100% 
yAccelerometer = 60-110 degrees
zAccelerometer = 60-110 degrees
LED = 0-1 boolean
REC = 0-1 boolean
Checksum = 0-255
End = 250

The following frame (6 bytes) is recieved via Bluetooth :
Start = 240 
PowerVolt = 0-255
PowerPourcent = 0-255
Temperatur = 0-255
Checksum = 0-255
End = 250

Checksum calculation:
for (byte data : datas) checksum += data;
checksum = checksum & 0xff;
checksum = 0xff - checksum
