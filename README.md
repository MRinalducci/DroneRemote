DroneRemote
===========

## Description

DroneRemote is an Android application for piloting drones (multicopter or what you want) with Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Profile) protocol on an Android device (SDK: 8+).

This project was developped with Android Studio (Intellij), but is also compatible with Eclipse.

Don't forget to import the project and not to open it.

I will be happy if you let me now if you used this project to make yours. :)

This application is available on the Google play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rinalducci.DroneRemote

## Changelog

30.12.2013 : Release on GitHub

## Getting Started

The whole code is commented, but here are some informations :

The following frame (11 bytes) is sent via Bluetooth :
- Start = 240 
- Throttle = 0-100%
- Yaw = 0-100%
- Pitch = 0-100% 
- Roll = 0-100% 
- yAccelerometer = 60-110 degrees
- zAccelerometer = 60-110 degrees
- LED = 0-1 boolean
- REC = 0-1 boolean
- Checksum = 0-255
- End = 250

The following frame (6 bytes) is recieved via Bluetooth :
- Start = 240 
- PowerVolt = 0-255
- PowerPourcent = 0-255
- Temperatur = 0-255
- Checksum = 0-255
- End = 250

Checksum calculation:
```java
for (byte data : datas) checksum += data;
checksum = checksum & 0xff;
checksum = 0xff - checksum
```
